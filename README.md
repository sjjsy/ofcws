A very simple PHP website to serve the needs of Otaniemi Fight Club.


## Purpose

Designed to provide a platform for providing basic static information updated casually (interval of a few months) and direct visitors to more up to date sources for more precise and actual information.


## Architecture

The architecture is a simple PHP hack. Each page includes a header and a footer file (pg-header.php, pg-footer.php) to wrap its content.
