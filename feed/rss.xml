			<title>True Training at Tatamisali</title>
			<description>
This Monday we had the pleasure to rewelcome an experienced fighter,
Teemu, back into our ranks. His return brings about not only a
guarantee of hard trainings ahead, but also an increased pace of learning
for all of us.

			<title>Beau Bashing at Otahalli</title>
			<description>
Today we had a French boxer, Roman, match us. His strong experience
and skill makes it a privilidge to fight him. Our pro-looking boxing
made Otahalli bystanders observe our training in awe. Some good
on-the-spot marketing here, eh!?
