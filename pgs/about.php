<h2>About</h2>


<h4>The Club</h4>
<p>
	Otaniemi Fight Club (OFC) is an association that operates under the Student
	Union of Aalto University. OFC is run by a small, but active group of
	students who are interested in practicing	martial arts.
</p>
<p>
	OFC organizes weekly sessions for wrestling and kickboxing. These make up
	the core of OFC's event calendar. In addition to the regular sessions the
	club organizes excursions to other martial arts clubs or schools or the like
	to boost learning. To spice up, events unrelated to martial arts are also
	included from time to time such as sauna nights, co-organized chillouts with
	other associations and introductions to other fields of sports.
