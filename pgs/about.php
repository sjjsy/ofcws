  Otaniemi Fight Club (OFC) is an association that operates under the Student
  Union of Aalto University. The club is run by a small group of students with
  a mutual interest: practicing martial arts.
</p>
<p>
  Otaniemi Fight Club was founded on the sixth of May 2010 with a clear
  purpose: <i>to enhance the opportunities of the students of Aalto University
  to practice martial arts</i>. This is the club's mission and what it pursues to
  accomplish in many levels -- not just by offering some square meters of
  tatami to train on, but also by providing some equipment, information and a
  forum for its members, and perhaps most importantly, the critical mass
  needed to accomplish things a lone fighter might not.
