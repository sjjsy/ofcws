<h2>About</h2>


<h4 id="club">The Club</h4>
<p>
  Otaniemi Fight Club (OFC) is an association that operates under the Student
  Union of Aalto University. The club is run by a small, but active group of
  students with a mutual interest: martial arts.
</p>
<p>
  Otaniemi Fight Club was founded on the sixth of May 2010 with a clear
  purpose: <i>to enhance the opportunities of the students of Aalto University
  to practice martial arts</i>. This is the club's mission and what it pursues to
  accomplish in many levels -- not just by offering some square meters of
  tatami to train on, but also by providing some equipment, information and a
  forum for its members, and perhaps most importantly, the critical mass
  needed to accomplish things a lone fighter might not.
</p>
<p>
  The club organizes weekly sessions for wrestling and kickboxing. These make up
  the core of the club's event calendar. In addition to the regular sessions the
  club organizes excursions to other martial arts clubs or schools or the like
  to boost learning. To spice up, events unrelated to martial arts are also
  included from time to time such as sauna nights, co-organized chillouts with
  other associations and introductions to other fields of sports. See the
  <a href="/pgs/events.php">events page</a> for information about current
  plans.
