<h2>About</h2>


<h4>The Club</h4>
<p>
	Otaniemi Fight Club (OFC) is an association that operates under the Student
	Union of Aalto University. OFC is run by a small, but active group of
	students with a mutual interest: martial arts.
</p>
<p>
	Otaniemi Fight Club was founded on the sixth of May 2010 with a clear
	purpose: <i>to enhance the opportunities of the students of Aalto University
	to practice martial arts</i>. This is OFC's mission and what it pursues to
	accomplish in many levels -- not just by offering some square meters of
	tatami to train on, but also by providing some equipment, information and a
	forum for its members, and perhaps most importantly, the critical mass
	needed to accomplish things a lone fighter might not.
</p>
<p>
	OFC organizes weekly sessions for wrestling and kickboxing. These make up
	the core of OFC's event calendar. In addition to the regular sessions the
	club organizes excursions to other martial arts clubs or schools or the like
	to boost learning. To spice up, events unrelated to martial arts are also
	included from time to time such as sauna nights, co-organized chillouts with
	other associations and introductions to other fields of sports. See the
	<a href="/pgs/events.php">events page</a> for information about current
	plans.
