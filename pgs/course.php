<h4>
  Objective
</h4>

<p>
  After this four session course the participants should have an idea
  of what Muay Thai, <i>the art of the four limbs</i>, is,
  how it can be trained,
  how some of its most essential techniques and moves can be applied,
  and, how martial arts can be trained safely.
  The objective is that even participants with no prior martial arts
  experience would then be able to join the club's weekly trainings
  (or attend a more thorough course).
</p>

<p>
  While this is a beginner-level course, more experienced participants
  (even those with specifically Muay Thai experience) should still
  benefit from the trainings as training the most essential basic
  techniques repeatedly is very rarely a waste of time.
</p>


<h4>
  Instructors
</h4>

<p>
  The primary instructor will be Antti Rantamoijanen.
  Jussila and Marisa will be present as secondary instructors in most trainings.

  <a href="/pgs/guides.php">
    guides page.

<h4>
  Costs
</h4>

<p>
  Costs
  <strong>
    only 15 euros.
  </strong>
  Paid either as 1) a bank transfer or 2) in cash:
  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>Bank transfer</b><br/>
      Destination: FI27 5380 1120 0352 71<br/>
      Message: "Muay Thai; Lastname, Firstnames"<br/>
      Deadline: 2014-11-07
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>In cash</b><br/>
      Bring the exact amount (as we might not have change) to the first or

    </li>
  </ol>
</p>

  The fee includes the 2014 fall membership for the club (right to
  attend any of our weekly trainings and other activities). Members
  who have already paid the membership fee for 2014 are eligible to
  participate in the course for a cute fee of 5 euros.
</p>


<h4>
  Requirements
</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    Good health
  </li>

    Good attitude
  </li>

    Experience and/or interest in martial arts
  </li>
  <li>
    Willingness to sign the Terms of Participation
    <a href="http://bit.ly/1co4oyc">in English</a> or

  </li>
</ol>


<h5>
  Equipment
</h5>

<p>
  Fully participating in full-contact exercises like boxing or MMA-sparring
  requires proper equipment. Use of insufficient or poor quality equipment
  can lead to injury.
</p>

<p>
  However, one can participate in about 90% of this course without
  any equipment due to the fact that the course is an introductory
  course that does not focus on contact sparring but instead consists
  of drills and exercises which require no special equipment.
  In addition, the club will be able to sell or lend some equipment such
  as boxing gloves, hand wraps and mouth guards.
</p>

<p>
  In case you are interested to acquire equipment yourself, the priority
  order is: 1) Mouth guard, 2) Boxing (sparring, 16 oz) or MMA gloves (padded),
  3) Jockstrap, 4) Shin guards, 5) Headgear.
</p>


<h4>
  Conclusions
</h4>

<p>
  8+ hours of beneficial exercise, lots of sweating & quality company guaranteed
  with a fee almost equal to zero (max. 2€/h), wrapped into an effective
  introductory package just <b>for You!</b>
</p>

<p>
  Yes, this course is an excellent way to (re)learn basic martial arts skills
  and get back to training and getting fit and able.
  You'll learn the needed Muay Thai techniques that you need for starting
  training regularly with members of Otaniemi Fight Club at our free weekly
