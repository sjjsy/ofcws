<h4>
  Costs
</h4>

<p>
  Costs
  <strong>only 15 euros</strong>.
  Paid in cash at the end of the second session
  (<strong>first session's free</strong>; Bring the exact amount as we might not have change).
</p>

<p>
  Includes the 2013 membership for the club (right to attend any of our weekly trainings and other activities).
</p>


<h4>
  Requirements
</h4>

<p>
  The only general requirements are normal health and a good attitude.
  No prior experience in martial arts expected.
  The teaching proceeds according to the capabilities of all participants.
</p>

<p>
  However, 
  <em>
    every participant must sign the
    Terms of Participation
  </em>
  either
    	<a href="http://bit.ly/1co4oyc">in English</a>, or
    	<a href="http://bit.ly/16YllRa">in Finnish</a>
  <small>
    (The documents will be available in paper at the exercises)
  </small>.
</p>

<p>
  Because OFC is probably unable to lend equipment for everyone
  you are required to get yourself the protective equipment mentioned in the document in case
  you want to fully participate in full-contact exercises like MMA-sparring.
  However, because this is an introductory course,
  most of the training consists of varying drills and other safer exercises
  which can be trained without all of the listed equipment
  if the appropriate focus and caution is given.
</p>

<p>
  The priority order for the acquisition of the equipment is: 1) Mouth guard, 2) Boxing or MMA gloves, 3) Jockstrap, 4) Shin guards, 5) Headgear.
</p>

<p>
  You can get working
	<a href="http://www.prisma.fi/market/prisma?b_haku.sana=0072363012549">
    mouth guards for just a couple of euros
  </a>
  and neither do the rest of the equipment cost that much
	(<a href="http://www.ufs.fi/kamppailuvarusteet-mma-hanskat-c-47_48.html">some MMA gloves</a>).
	And just to make it clear: You
	<em>
	  can
	</em>
	attend the course without having the equipment and we can even lend some of them.
</p>


<h4>
  Fightburgerfest?
</h4>

<p>
  In December (date yet TBD) we will be celebrating the ending of
  this course and OFC's fourth calendar year with a feast of beefy self-made high quality
  hamburgers, fries and some appropriate video material at Kylän olohuone (might change)
  and everyone who participated in this course is welcome for free.
  Vote for the date that best suits you at our
	<a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/107657179302080/">
	  FB group
  </a>.
