<h4>
  Instructors
</h4>

<p>
  All of the course's instructors are members of the club, students and experienced martial artists. Here's a brief description of each:
</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-7">
    <strong>
      Antti Rantamoijanen
    </strong>
    <p>
      School: University of Helsinki<br/>
      Background: Muay Thai<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      Antti was asked to become an instructor to make sure you get a good
      introduction to MMA and more precisely the art that arguably ties all
      areas of MMA together most effectively: The Art of the Eight Limbs.
      In his sessions you will learn core Muay Thai techniques and how to apply
      them. Pay attention in his sessions and you'll double your offensive
      arsenal. The man knows all the important stuff and is a proven instructor.

    <strong>
      Heikki Jussila
    </strong>
    <p>
      School: Aalto School of Engineering<br/>
      Background: Competetive Judo, MMA<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      Heikki was asked to become an instructor to have you learn how to overcome an
      opponent without the need to rely on punches and kicks. He will introduce you to
      wrestling and notably submission wrestling. Heikki has lots of experience
      from a wide range of martial arts. He will show you that there are many
      ways to vanquish an opponent and that you're the one to choose your approach
      for each situation.

    <strong>
      Roman Mouginot
    </strong>
    <p>
      School: Aalto School of Engineering<br/>
      Background: Boxing and French Boxing<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      Roman was asked to become an instructor to make sure you get a real taste
      of what boxing is all about.
      He knows what one needs to know and work on in order
      to succeed in hand to hand fighting. His sessions will give you a straight
      to the business type intro to the essentials of boxing. His sessions will
      put your boxing gloves and mouth guards into the use they were made for! ;)

<h4>
  Costs
</h4>

<p>
  Costs
  <strong>
    only 25 euros.
  </strong>
  Paid either as 1) a bank transfer or 2) in cash:
  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>Bank transfer</b><br/>
      Destination: FI51 5720 9920 1081 48<br/>
      Message: "I2MMA2; Lastname, Firstnames"<br/>
      Deadline: 2014-03-03
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>In cash</b><br/>
      Bring the exact amount (as we might not have change) to the second session (2014-03-07).
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>
  The fee includes the 2014 membership for the club (right to attend any of our weekly trainings and other activities). Members who have already paid the membership fee for 2014 are eligible to participate in the course for a cute fee of 5 euros.
</p>


<h4>
  Requirements
</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    Good health
  </li>
  <li>
    Good attitude
  </li>
  <li>
    Experience and/or interest in martial arts
  </li>
  <li>
    Willingness to sign the Terms of Participation
  	<a href="http://bit.ly/1co4oyc">in English</a> or
  	<a href="http://bit.ly/16YllRa">in Finnish</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some equipment (read more below)
  </li>
</ol>


<h5>
  Equipment
</h5>

<p>
  Fully participating in full-contact exercises like boxing or MMA-sparring requires proper equipment. Use of insufficient or poor quality equipment can lead to injury.
</p>

<p>
  However, one can participate in at least about 70% of the course without any equipment due to the fact that the course has a lot of drills and exercises where there is no hard contact. In addition, the club will be able to sell or lend some equipment such as boxing gloves, hand wraps and mouth guards. No equipment is needed for the first session.
</p>

<p>
  In case you are interested to acquire equipment yourself, the priority order is: 1) Mouth guard, 2) Boxing (sparring, 16 oz) or MMA gloves (padded), 3) Jockstrap, 4) Shin guards, 5) Headgear.
</p>

<!--
<p>
  The club is going to make
  <b>
    an order of new MMA-equipment
  </b>
  either prior to the course or after the first session (undecided).
  The club will get the items with lowered prices.
  If you're interested in having the club order your equipment for you,
  please write about it into the registration form (link below).
  We'll contact you.
</p>
-->

<h4>
  Conclusions
</h4>

<p>
  14+ hours of beneficial exercise, lots of sweating & quality company guaranteed
  with a fee almost equal to zero (max. 2â¬/h), wrapped into an intense & effective package
  just <b>for You!</b>
</p>
