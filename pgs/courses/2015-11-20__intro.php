<h4>
  Location
</h4>

<p>
  The session will be held in the sports hall named "Monitoimihalli"
  in Unisport Otaniemi's Otahalli facilities. The address is
  Otaranta 6, 02150 Espoo. The tatami area isn't visible when you get
  into the hall. You must walk to the far-left corner to spot it.
  In case you have a valid Unisport subscription, you can register for
  the session via the Unisport reader, otherwise just say you're going
  to attend "Vapaaottelu" to the receptionists. Finding the place and
  changing your clothes at the dressing rooms might take time, so
  please adjust your schedules accordingly.
</p>


<h4>
  Requirements
</h4>

<p>
  There are no odd requirements for participation except normal health and a
  social positive attitude.
  There's no need for special equipment.
  A sturdy pair of shorts and a t-shirt will do.
  No socks on the tatami.
  Just remember to round your nails and lay an eye on this document
	<a href="http://bit.ly/1co4oyc">in English</a> or
	<a href="http://bit.ly/16YllRa">in Finnish</a>.

<h4>
  Content
</h4>

<p>
  The schedule above is a rough sketch to let you know what to expect.
  The objective of the session is to give you a quick & compact introduction to
  the sport we refer to as MMA and martial arts in general. You will also learn
  more about our club, who we are and how and why we train.
</p>

<p>
  Even though the session is novice friendly, we'll make you sweat. The session
  also contains some sparring-like pair exercises. This is going to include
  a few soft-contact exercises. But fear not: at OFC we train as ladies and
  gentlemen.
</p>


<h4>
  Conclusions
</h4>

<p>
  A free, compact, hard-to-beat chance to get to know more about the club and
  MMA.
