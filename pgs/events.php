  Below you should see our public Google Calendar.
  We try to keep it as up to date as we can.
</p>
<p>
  You can add the calendar into your Google Calendar using the button at
  the lower right corner.
  Alternatively you should be able to add the calendar to a third party
  calendar app using the calendar's
    <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/m8540j7mbg1akg32rvhfb6uir4%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic">XML feed</a>.
  Highly recommended!
