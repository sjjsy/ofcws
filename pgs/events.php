  <b>
    Sadly, OFC has run out of active people willing to organize its activities.
  </b>
  Thus there are no events in our calendar and <b>this page is deprecated.</b>
  In fact, OFC as a club is at great risk of being completely shut down unless
  we find an active person willing to devote some time (preferably at least an
  hour a month) to keeping the club running. Please read the
  <a href="/pgs/about.php#board">
    About page
    </a>
  for more info.

  Below you should see our public Google Calendar.
  We try to keep it as up to date as we can.
</p>
<p>
  You can add the calendar into your Google Calendar using the button at
  the lower right corner.
  Alternatively you should be able to add the calendar to a third party
  calendar app using the calendar's
    <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/m8540j7mbg1akg32rvhfb6uir4%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics">ICAL address</a>
  or inspect the calendar with the browser using its
    <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=m8540j7mbg1akg32rvhfb6uir4%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe/Helsinki">HTML link</a>.
  Highly recommended!

	In the fall of 2015 we have about three trainings per week.
	There will be an attendance poll in
	<a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/107657179302080/">Facebook</a>
	for each training. Please, use it to indicate when you are participating
	-- trainings are cancelled if there are too few people interested.
