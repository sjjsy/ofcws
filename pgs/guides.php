      Roman is a hard core boxer.
      While he has some experience from BJJ and other fields as well
      he's been more or less exclusively focused on boxing throughout
      his martial arts career.
      He trains hard and doesn't waste time on talking nonsense which
      makes him an effective instructor.
      Getting a peek on his boxing skills and training style is
      valuable no matter which part of MMA you decide to focus on.

      During his years at OFC he has doubled his abilities and arsenal
      of techniques.
      He has been pretty devoted to developing the club and his
      martial arts skills since his first encounter with the club back
      in late 2012.
      While he is no master in any of the areas of MMA, he handles most ok
      and knows what newbies should focus on.
      He trains for fitness and develops OFC for you!
