<h4>
  Location
</h4>

<p>
  The session will be held in the sports hall named "Monitoimihalli" in Unisport Otaniemi's Otahalli facilities. The address is Otaranta 6, 02150 Espoo. The tatami area isn't visible when you get into the hall. You must walk to the far-left corner to spot it. In case you have a valid Unisport subscription, you can register for the session via the Unisport reader, otherwise just say you're going to attend "Vapaaottelu" to the receptionists. Finding the place and changing your clothes at the dressing rooms might take time, so please adjust your schedules accordingly.
</p>


<h4>
  Requirements
</h4>

<p>
  There are no odd requirements for participation except normal health and a
  social positive attitude.
  There's no need for special equipment.
  A sturdy pair of shorts and a t-shirt will do.
  No socks on the tatami.
  Just remember to round your nails and lay an eye on this document

<h4>
  Content
</h4>

<p>
  The schedule above is a rough sketch to let you know what to expect.
  The objective of the session is to give you a quick & compact introduction to
  the sport we refer to as MMA and martial arts in general. You will also learn
  more about our club, who we are and how and why we train.
</p>

<p>
  Even though the session is novice friendly, we'll make you sweat. The session
  also contains an introduction to the art of sparring. This is going to include
  a few soft-contact exercises. But fear not: at OFC we train as ladies and gentlemen.
</p>


<h4>
  Introducers
</h4>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-7">
    <strong>
      Heikki Jussila
    </strong>
    <p>
      School: Aalto School of Engineering<br/>
      Background: Competetive Judo, MMA<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      Heikki was asked to be your introducer, since his experience in martial arts is
      long and broad. He's fit to guide you to both the stand-up and on-the-ground
      arts, styles and techniques. He's experienced as an instructor and knows
      all about the club as well.<br/>

    <strong>
      Roman Mouginot
    </strong>
    <p>
      School: Aalto School of Engineering<br/>
      Background: Boxing and French Boxing<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      Roman was asked to accompany Heikki since as a quasi-professional boxer
      he's perfect for complementing Jussila's expertise and approach. While he
      has some experience from BJJ and other fields as well he's been more or less
      exclusively focused on boxing throughout his martial arts career.
      Getting a peek on his approach, teachings and training style is valuable to
      all novice martial artists.
