<h4>
  Location
</h4>

<p>
  All sessions will be held either in Tatamisali or in Otahalli. Here's
  a brief description on how to find them:
</p>

<p>
  <b>Tatamisali</b>: Jämeräntaival 5 A, Espoo.<br>
  After you enter from the A entrance you'll see the white door of Tatamisali
  5 meters directly right from you.
  Usually we switch to our training gear inside the tatami hall.
  Another possibility is to use the sauna's dressing room downstairs
  (in case its free).
  In case the door is closed you should call the key holder that is
  participating in the event.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Otahalli</b>: Otaranta 6, Espoo.<br>
  The tatami area is located in the left side of the sports hall named
  "Monitoimihalli" at "Heittopaikka". When not in use, the tatami pieces
  are stored in a stack. At the start/finish of trainings we deploy/stack
  the pieces. The tatami area isn't visible from the entrance of the hall.
  You must walk to the far-left corner to spot it at your left.
  <br>
  In case you have a valid Unisport subscription, you should register
  to the sessions via the Unisport reader, otherwise just say you're
  going to attend "Vapaaottelu" to the receptionists.
  Finding the place and changing your clothes at the dressing rooms
  might take time, so please adjust your schedules accordingly.
  You should take a small bell lock to keep your stuff safe at a locker.
</p>


<h4>
  Requirements
</h4>

<p>
  In most sessions there are no odd requirements for participation
  except normal health and a sporty, positive and social attitude.
  You are not forced to acquire any special equipment.
  A sturdy pair of shorts and a t-shirt will do.
  We train barefoot on the tatami.
  Just remember to round your nails and lay an eye on this document
  <a href="http://bit.ly/1co4oyc">in English</a> or
  <a href="http://bit.ly/16YllRa">in Finnish</a>.
  You are required to sign it once you really start training with us.
</p>


<h4>
  Content
</h4>

<p>
  <b>The New Fighters' Nights</b> are regular Monday trainings with a
  more relaxed and open twist specifically targeted for newbies.
  There might be more experienced members doing some BJJ training which
  you can simply watch, but in case you feel like it. You can also join
  the action and give a try yourself.
  In these sessions there is no fixed programme, but you can expect
  free snacks and the friendly company of some of our members.
  You may participate without equipment.
</p>

<p>
  The <b>Basics of Boxing I</b> and <b>II</b> sessions are
  independent sessions targeted to people with interest on developing their
  boxing skills.
  The instructor will be Roman Mouginot which means the training will be
  worth your time no matter your level.
  Both sessions start with a proper warmup, continue with technique drills and
  finish with some sort of sparring.
  In order to participate, you should bring your own mouth guards and
  boxing gloves (though we have a few pairs we might be able to lend).
</p>

<p>
  The <b>BJJ Tryout</b> session is for everyone interested in training
  Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and/or submission wrestling. We train that regularly
  at Tatamisali. There you'll get to learn some basic moves and see more
  of what the sport is really about.
  You will also learn more about our club, who we are and how and why we train.
  Heikki Jussila will be the primary instructor there.
  You may participate without equipment.
  And don't worry, it will be good exercise!
</p>


<h4>
  Guides
</h4>

<p>
  There will be at least two of our main guides there for you at each session.
  You can find a brief description of these guys at our
  <a href="/pgs/guides.php">
    guides page.
  </a>
</p>


<h4>
  Conclusions
</h4>

<p>
  A few interesting chances to get to know more about the club,
  and more importantly, about what and how we train. All for free.
</p>
