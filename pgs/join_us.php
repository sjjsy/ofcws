<p>
	Only OFC's members are allowed to fully participate in the club's activities.
	However, everybody who considers joining the club can come first visit us in
	one of our weekly trainings in order to get to know us, before	committing the
	membership fee.
</p>


<h4 id="whocan">Who Can Join?</h4>

<p>
	OFC is primarily for the students of Aalto University and we might limit the
	number of outsiders due to the constraints set by our resources. However,
	even non-Aaltoers can be accepted as half-members, after which they have
	the right to take part in OFC's activities.
</p>


<h4 id="costs">What Does It Cost?</h4>

<p>
	The membership fee for 2013 is 20 euros. Some special events might have a small
	additional fee but in these cases the amount is always informed clearly
	beforehand. The weekly core sessions are free.
</p>
