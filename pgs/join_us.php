    Sadly, OFC has run out of active people willing to organize its activities.
  </b>
  Thus <b>this page is deprecated!</b>
  In fact, OFC as a club is at great risk of being completely shut down unless
  we find an active person willing to devote some time (preferably at least an
  hour a month) to keeping the club running. Please read the
  <a href="/pgs/about.php#board">
    About page
    </a>
  for more info.
</p>

<h4 id="why">Why</h4>

<p>
  The club exists to serve its members.
  Only members are allowed to fully participate in the club's activities and
  benefit from what the club can offer.
  Non-members are only allowed to visit a few weekly trainings in order to get
  familiar with the club before committing the membership fee.
</p>

The club offers:
<ol>
  <li>
    Like-minded fellow members
  </li>
  <li>
    Training opportunities, facilities and equipment
  </li>
  <li>
    Training instruction
  </li>
  <li>
    Social pressure and help to keep you fit :)
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Some courses and special events might have a small additional fee but in
  these cases the amount is always informed clearly beforehand.
  The weekly core sessions are always free for members.
</p>


<h4 id="whocan">Who Can Join</h4>

<p>
  The club is primarily by and for the students of Aalto University and we
  might need to limit the number of outsiders due to our constrained
  resources.
  However, even non-Aaltoers can be accepted as half-members, after
  which they have the right to take part in our activities.
</p>


<h4 id="costs">What Does It Cost</h4>

<p>
<!--  The annual membership fee has been from 10 to 30 euros during the past years.
  It has been also possible to join for only the spring or fall term but the
  fee for such a term has usually been more than half of the whole year fee.
  The details are decided annually around March.-->
  The membership fee for 2016 is 12€ and 8€ for just one semester.
</p>


<h3 id="join">Become a Member!</h4>

<h4 id="payment">Paying the Fee</h4>

<!--
<p>
  The magnitude of the fee for 2016 will be decided in the Annual Meeting in
  march. The payment DL will also be decided in the meeting.
</p>-->
<p>
  We'd very much prefer receiving the membership fee payment as a bank transfer:
  <ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>Receiver: Otaniemi Fight Club</li>
    <li>Account IBAN: FI27 5380 1120 0352 71</li>
    <li>Full year:</li>
      <ul>
      <li>Message: Membership 2016 full; <i>Lastname, Firstnames</i>
      <li>Amount: 12 €</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Half year:</li>
      <ul>
      <li>Message: Membership 2016 half; <i>Lastname, Firstnames</i>
      <li>Amount: 8 €</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Deadline: Now</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  However, if you cannot do the transfer, it is also possible to pay in cash by
  bringing the exact amount to one of the club's board members.
