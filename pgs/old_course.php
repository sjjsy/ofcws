        THE COURSE IS BOOKED!
      </strong>
      We cannot fit more participants in. If you are interested, please consider attending our following course (possibly in spring 2014).
    </p>
    <p>
      We highly appreciate your interest, but the facilities we have in our disposal are small and to make sure we can offer quality training we have to limit the number of participants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe instead of participating in the course this time you could start preparing for the future ones! Exercise your body and consider joining following course instances organized possibly even already in spring 2014.

<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong>
  We duplicated each session at Tatamisali because the space there is limited (Attend the one you registered for).

<p>
  Yes, its all in our Google Calendar. Subscribe to it at the
	<a href="/pgs/events.php">events page</a>.
</p>


<h4>
  Costs
</h4>

<p>
  Costs
  <strong>only 15 euros</strong>.
  Paid in cash at the end of the second session
  (<strong>first session's free</strong>; Bring the exact amount as we might not have change).
</p>

<p>
  Includes the 2013 membership for the club (right to attend any of our weekly trainings and other activities).
</p>


<h4>
  Requirements
</h4>

<p>
  The only general requirements are normal health and a good attitude.
  No prior experience in martial arts expected.
  The teaching proceeds according to the capabilities of all participants.
</p>

<p>
  However, 
  <em>
    every participant must sign the
    Terms of Participation
  </em>
  either
    	<a href="http://bit.ly/1co4oyc">in English</a>, or
    	<a href="http://bit.ly/16YllRa">in Finnish</a>
  <small>
    (The documents will be available in paper at the exercises)
  </small>.
</p>

<p>
  Because OFC is probably unable to lend equipment for everyone
  you are required to get yourself the protective equipment mentioned in the document in case
  you want to fully participate in full-contact exercises like MMA-sparring.
  However, because this is an introductory course,
  most of the training consists of varying drills and other safer exercises
  which can be trained without all of the listed equipment
  if the appropriate focus and caution is given.
</p>

<p>
  The priority order for the acquisition of the equipment is: 1) Mouth guard, 2) Boxing or MMA gloves, 3) Jockstrap, 4) Shin guards, 5) Headgear.
</p>

<p>
  You can get working
	<a href="http://www.prisma.fi/market/prisma?b_haku.sana=0072363012549">
    mouth guards for just a couple of euros
  </a>
  and neither do the rest of the equipment cost that much
	(<a href="http://www.ufs.fi/kamppailuvarusteet-mma-hanskat-c-47_48.html">some MMA gloves</a>).
	And just to make it clear: You
	<em>
	  can
	</em>
	attend the course without having the equipment and we might even be able to lend some.
</p>


<h4>
  Fightburgerfest?
</h4>

<p>
  After the first Friday session after the course at 18-22
  we will be celebrating the ending of
  this course and OFC's fourth calendar year with a feast of beefy self-made
  hamburgers, fries and some appropriate video material
  and everyone who participated in this course is welcome for free.
  The election of the board of 2014 is going to occur in the event as well.
</p>


<h4>
  Conclusions
</h4>

<p>
  14+ hours of beneficial exercise, lots of sweating & quality company guaranteed
  with a fee almost equal to zero (€1/h), wrapped into an intense & effective package
  just for You!
</p>

<p>
  Yes, this course is the perfect introduction to Mixed Martial Arts and martial arts
  in general (If you disagree, come to share
  <em>
    your hearts content
  </em>
  at our next training).
